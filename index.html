                <p>The Yellow Cab Company was a taxicab company in Chicago which was founded in 1907 by <b>John D.
                        Hertz</b>.
                </p>
                <p>In 1920 the Yellow Cab Manufacturing Company was formed to manufacture taxicabs.</p>
                <p>During the 1910s and 1920s the company was involved in considerable illegal activity relating to
                    mobsters and
                    in particular to the Chicago Outfit. Yellow Cab was involved in a bitter rivalry with Checker Taxi
                    at the
                    time which led to a number of shootings, deaths and firebombings.</p>
                <p>By 1925 the company was a subsidiary of the 'Chicago Yellow Cab Company', a public holding company
                    with
                    shares equally divided amongst Hertz, Parmelee and a small group of other investors. Hertz sold the
                    Yellow
                    Cab Manufacturing Company to General Motors in 1925. He sold his remaining interest in the Yellow
                    Cab
                    Company in 1929. Yellow Cab Co. (of Chicago) was bought by Morris Markin, who had established
                    Checker Cab
                    Manufacturing Company, with the Checker Taxi, a driver's cooperative.</p>

            <p><strong>John D. Hertz</strong> was an American businessman, thoroughbred racehorse owner and breeder, and
                philanthropist.
            </p>
            <p>Born Schandor Herz April 10, 1879<br>Szklabinya, Austria-Hungary</p>
            <p>Died October 8, 1961<br>Chicago, Illinois, U.S.</p>

            <ul class="list-group my-3">
                <li class="list-group-item">President of the Yellow Cab Company</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Chairman Benzoline Motor Fuel Company</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Chairman Chicago Motor Coach Company</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Chairman Fifth Avenue Coach Company</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Chairman New York Transportation Company</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Chairman Omnibus Corporation of America</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Chairman Yellow Sleeve-Valve Engine Works</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Chairman Yellow Truck and Coach Manufacturing Company</li>
            </ul>
            
       

        <p>In 1929 he sold his remaining share of Yellow Cab to concentrate on car rental (later Hertz Rent-a-Car which
            incidentally still uses a yellow logo). The sale was prompted by the violence associated with the business
            that culminated in 1928 in his racing stables being destroyed in a $200,000 fire.</p>
        <p>Yellow Cab Co. was sold again in 1996 to Patton Corrigan, who in turn sold controlling interest in 2005 to
            Michael Levine, a third-generation taxicab operator from New York City. The Levine/Corrigan group has also
            purchased the Checker Taxi Affiliation in Chicago, to reunite the two companies once again. In 2015, Yellow
            Cab of Chicago filed for bankruptcy. Yellow Cab Co eventually split into multiple companies across the
            nation bearing the Yellow Cab name. In January 2016, San Francisco's Yellow Cab filed for bankruptcy
            protection.</p>
